        <h3> Tartuffe </h3>
        <h6>The Act of play is SCENE V and it is the conversation between Elmire and Tartuffe</h6>
        <p>
            <h6 class="Elmire speech"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p>  You're hurting me.</p>
            <h6 class="Tartuffe speech"><b>Tartuffe:</b></h6><p> Passion pushes me too much.
                        I never wanted to hurt you, I swear,
                        And I would rather . . .
                        [He puts his hand on her knee.]</p>
            <h6 class="Elmire speech"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p> Why is your hand there?</p>
            <h6 class="Tartuffe speech"><b>Tartuffe:</b></h6><p>  I'm feeling your dress.  Such fine dimity!</p>
            <h6 class="Elmire speech"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p>  Oh!  Please let me go.  You're tickling me.[She pushes her chair back, and Tartuffe moves his forward.] </p> 
            <h6 class="Tartuffe speech"><b>Tartuffe [putting his hand on her lacy collar]:</b></h6><p>  Dear Lord!  But this workmanship is marvelous!
                        Lacework nowadays is miraculous.
                        I've never seen anything quite so fine.</p> 
            <h6 class="Elmire speech"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p>  That's true.  But let's speak of this concern of mine.
                        I hear that my husband may be breaking his word
                        And giving you his daughter.  What have you heard?</p>
