    <h6 class="name"><b>Tartuffe:</b></h6><p class="Tartuffe speech">In truth, madam, some such words did transpire,
        But that is not the joy to which I aspire,
        And I see elsewhere those splendid attractions
        Which I seek to attain through all of my actions.</p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p class="Elmire speech">Then all your earthly love has been overthrown?
        <h6 class=" name"><b>Tartuffe:</b></h6><p class="Tartuffe speech">  My breast does not hold a heart made of stone.</p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Elmire:</b></h6><p class="Elmire speech"> I'm sure that all your thoughts are on salvation,
        And nothing less holds any fascination.</p>
        <h6 class="name"><b>Tartuffe:</b></h6><p class="Tartuffe speech"> The love that attracts us to what's eternal
        Does not stop our love for the merely temporal.</p>
